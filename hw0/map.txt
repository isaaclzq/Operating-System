1. Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?

2. Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the Internet if you donâ€™t know).

3. What direction is the stack growing in?
downward.

4. How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?

5. Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?

6. Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their addresses?)
